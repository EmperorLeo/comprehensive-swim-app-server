# comprehensive-swim-app-server
This is the server side code for a yet to be named swim app.

### Setup
To install mongoDB (the database), obviously install it from [here](https://www.mongodb.org).

Next, place the unzipped file somewhere acceptable.

Cd into that directory, cd into it's bin folder, and type <pre><code>./mongod --dbpath <PATH_TO_DATA></code></pre>

This should make it listen on port 27017.

Open another terminal tab, go to bin folder again, and type <pre><code>./mongo</code></pre>

Congrats! You have access to the console now.

At this point, you probably want to type in: <pre><code>use comprehensive-swim-app-server</code></pre>

Now you can do whatever the hell you want.  Hopefully the databases are already set up.  I'll get back to this later.
